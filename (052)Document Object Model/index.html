<!-- The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. It allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents dynamically.

It provides a structured representation of the document (like a tree with nodes).
It allows JavaScript to access, modify, add, or delete elements and attributes.
It updates the web page dynamically without requiring a reload. -->

<!-- BOM (Browser Object Model)
The BOM is a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with the browser itself (outside the webpage content).

It provides access to the browser window, history, location, navigator, screen, and more.
It enables JavaScript to control browser functionalities like opening/closing new windows, adjusting screen properties, and handling user navigation.
Unlike the DOM, the BOM is not standardized and may vary across browsers. -->
